## Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax

## Use input-output redirection (>, >>, |, 2>, etc.)

Input and output in Linux is handled via three streams. These streams are called:

| File Stream     | Name            | Integer | Description |
| :----------:    |-----------------| :-----:   |-------------|
| stdin           | Standard Input  | 0       | 0           |
| stdout          | Standard Output | 1       | 1           |
| stderr          | Standard Error  | 2       | 2           |

standard input (stdin)
standard output (stdout)
standard error (stderr)

Each stream is associated with a number

stdin (0)
stdout (1)
stderr (2)

Various redirection operators allow us to take the standard streams and pass it's content elsewhere.

`>`
`>>`
`|`
`2>`
`&>`

There are also some commond Linux commands that handle streams:
`xargs`
`tee`
